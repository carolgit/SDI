# A Evaluation Model For Brazillian Spatial Data InfraStructures

This model is based in W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices and is meant to serve as a management tool to whom it may concern, the following aspects:

  - Spatial Data Infrastructure Planning 
  - Spatial Data Infrastructure Control

# This is not indicated to:

  - To evaluate quality, because best practices are not rules are recommendations.
  - To overwrite the National standards


To understand if this model will be helpful to you, you need:
  - Know about your country National Spatial Data Infrastructure standards and rules 
  - Learn more about W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices
  - Understand your Local Spatial Data Infrastructure needs

### Model

| GIS's Identifier: [ID]                       | GIS Action Type:   - [IN or OUT]      |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Map Server's name :[Name of the server used] | Map Server's version:[Version of the server] |


Server used for:

- [ ] Save spatial data indirectly by Web GIS
- [ ] Save spatial data indirectly by Desktop GIS
- [ ] Save spatial data directly by User interaction

Server Functionalities:

- [ ] Basic service sets as WFS and WMS
- [ ] Allow apply a filter in Spatial Things
- [ ] Allow executing operations as Intersect, Contains, and others
- [ ] Allow reprojection by changing a parameter on URI
- [ ] Contains a uniform URI organization adopting web semantic links 
- [ ] Support basic data formats as Shapefile, GeoTIFF, CSV, KML, Spatial Database 
- [ ] Can generate data as Geojson that can be requested in chunks by paging 
- [ ] Can title WFS and WMS
- [ ] Can search between multiple spatial things
